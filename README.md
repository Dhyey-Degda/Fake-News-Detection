# Fake-News-Detection
This python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build Count Vectorizer, TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier, MultinomialNB Classifier and fit the model.We also use TFIDF Transformer and SGD Classifier. In the end,  the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
